# Companion Herb Garden: An Interactive Learning Project

## Welcome, Fellow Gardeners!

This repository serves as an interactive, project-based learning module for students, educators, and gardening enthusiasts. Dive into the ancient practice of **companion planting** and design your own themed culinary herb garden. Whether you're planning a pizza-topping paradise, a soothing tea garden, or a vibrant salad corner, this project will guide you through the science, history, and art of growing plants that help each other thrive.

## Project Goals

1. **Learn** the principles of companion planting and why certain plants grow better together.
2. **Explore** the history, culture, and uses of common culinary herbs and vegetables.
3. **Design** a personalized garden layout based on companion planting guidelines.
4. **Collaborate** by reviewing and discussing each other's garden plans.
5. **Grow** your confidence as a gardener and a community member.

## How to Participate

### 1. Claim a Garden Plot
- Go to the [Issues tab](https://github.com/cuines/companion-herb-garden/issues) and look for open issues titled `Garden Plot #N`.
- Choose an unclaimed plot and leave a comment stating your name and your garden's culinary theme (e.g., “Italian kitchen garden,” “medicinal tea garden,” “summer salsa garden”).
- That plot is now yours! The issue will be assigned to you.

### 2. Study the Plant Library
- Inside the [`plants/`](plants/) directory, you'll find Markdown files for various herbs, vegetables, and flowers.
- Each file contains:
  - A brief history and cultural significance.
  - Key growing requirements (sun, soil, water).
  - Lists of beneficial companion plants and plants to avoid.
  - Culinary or medicinal uses.
- Use this information to select plants that will support each other in your garden.

### 3. Fork and Branch
- **Fork** this repository to your own GitHub account.
- Create a new branch named `yourname‑garden‑plan` (replace `yourname` with your GitHub username or real name).

### 4. Create Your Garden Plan
- In the `submissions/` directory, create a new Markdown file named `yourname-garden-plan.md`.
- Your file must include:
  - **Your name** and **garden theme**.
  - **A list of chosen plants** (at least 3–5).
  - **Justifications** for why these plants are good companions, referencing the information in the `plants/` files.
  - **A simple layout** of your garden, using either a Markdown table or ASCII art.
  - (Optional) A short narrative about why you chose this theme and what you hope to harvest.

### 5. Submit Your Plan
- Commit your changes and push your branch to your fork.
- Open a **Pull Request** from your branch to the `main` branch of this repository.

## Plant Library

The following plants are currently documented (more may be added!):

- **Basil** – Aromatic, pest‑repelling herb loved in Italian and Southeast Asian cuisines.
- **Rosemary** – Hardy Mediterranean shrub that improves flavor of neighboring plants.
- **Tomato** – Classic garden favorite that benefits from basil and marigold.
- **Marigold** – Bright flower that deters nematodes and attracts beneficial insects.
- **Borage** – Edible blue‑star flower that attracts pollinators and improves tomato health.

Each file contains detailed information to help you make informed companion choices.

## Review Guidelines

When reviewing a garden‑plan Pull Request, consider:

- **Compatibility**: Are the chosen plants known to be good companions? Do any antagonistic pairs appear?
- **Justification**: Does the author explain why the plants work well together, using evidence from the plant library?
- **Layout**: Is the garden arrangement logical (e.g., taller plants not shading shorter sun‑lovers)?
- **Creativity**: Does the theme come through? Is the plan enjoyable to read?

Be kind, constructive, and curious—this is a learning community!
