### To claim this plot:

   - Your name (or GitHub username)
   - A brief description of your garden theme (e.g., “pizza‑topping garden,” “tea garden,” “Mediterranean herb spiral,” “salad‑bowl garden”)
2. Wait for a maintainer to assign the issue to you (or self‑assign if permissions allow).

### Once you have claimed a plot:
- Fork this repository.
- Create a new branch named `yourname‑garden‑plan`.
- Study the plant library in the [`plants/`](../../plants/) directory.
- Create your garden‑plan Markdown file in the [`submissions/`](../../submissions/) directory.
- Open a Pull Request following the “Garden Plan Review” template.

### Need inspiration?
- Look at the existing plant files for companion‑planting suggestions.
- Browse other participants’ submissions (once they appear).
