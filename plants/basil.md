# Basil (*Ocimum basilicum*)

## History & Cultural Significance

Basil has been cultivated for over 5,000 years, with origins in India and Southeast Asia. It held sacred status in Hindu tradition and was used in Ayurvedic medicine. Ancient Greeks and Romans associated basil with both love and hatred, and it was believed to have protective properties. In Italy, basil became a symbol of love and is a key ingredient in pesto, representing the essence of Mediterranean cuisine.
