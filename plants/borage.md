# Borage (*Borago officinalis*)

## History & Cultural Significance

Borage is an ancient herb native to the Mediterranean region. Its name may derive from the Latin *borra* (“rough hair”), referring to its hairy leaves and stems. In medieval Europe, borage was associated with courage and gladness; knights drank borage‑infused wine before battle, and the flowers were embroidered on tapestries as a symbol of fearlessness. The Roman naturalist Pliny the Elder wrote that borage could “make men merry and joyful.” Throughout history, it has been cultivated both as a culinary herb and a medicinal plant, valued for its cucumber‑like flavor and its ability to attract bees.

## Growing Requirements

- **Sun**: Full sun to partial shade (at least 4–6 hours of direct sun).
- **Soil**: Adaptable, but prefers moderately rich, well‑drained soil. Tolerates poor, dry soils once established.
- **Water**: Drought‑tolerant; water regularly until established, then only during prolonged dry spells.
- **Temperature**: Hardy annual; can tolerate light frosts. Self‑seeds readily, often returning year after year.
- **Height**: Grows 2–3 feet (60–90 cm) tall, with a sprawling habit.

## Companion Planting Guide

### Beneficial Companions

Borage is a dynamic companion plant that improves the health and flavor of many vegetables and fruits.

- **Tomatoes** – Attracts pollinators, deters tomato hornworms, and may enhance tomato growth and flavor.
- **Strawberries** – Improves strawberry yield and repels pests; the two are classic companions.
- **Squash & Cucumbers** – Attracts bees for better pollination, deters cabbage worms.
- **Brassicas** (cabbage, broccoli) – Repels cabbage worms and enhances growth.
- **Beans** – Encourages nitrogen‑fixing bacteria, improving soil fertility.
- **Fruit trees** – Planted as an understory to attract pollinators and improve soil.
- **Most herbs & vegetables** – Borage is generally friendly and beneficial.

### Antagonistic Plants

- **No serious antagonistic relationships** – Borage gets along with almost everything.
- **Some sources suggest avoiding planting near black walnut trees** (due to juglone toxicity, which affects many plants).

## Culinary & Medicinal Uses

### Culinary
- **Fresh leaves** – Young leaves have a mild cucumber flavor; chop and add to salads, green smoothies, or sandwiches.
- **Flowers** – The stunning blue, star‑shaped flowers are edible and make beautiful garnishes for drinks, desserts, and salads.
- **Candied flowers** – Dipped in egg white and sugar for cake decorations.
- **Herbal tea** – Dried leaves and flowers make a refreshing, slightly cooling tea.
- **Flavoring** – Used in traditional German *Frankfurter Grüne Soße* (green sauce) and in Mediterranean dishes.

### Medicinal
- Traditionally used as a diuretic, anti‑inflammatory, and to promote lactation in nursing mothers.
- Contains gamma‑linolenic acid (GLA), an omega‑6 fatty acid that may support skin health and reduce inflammation.
- Borage seed oil is sold as a dietary supplement for rheumatoid arthritis and eczema.
- The leaves were historically used to treat fever, cough, and depression (“herb of gladness”).

## Quick Tips

- Borage is a prolific self‑sower; if you don’t want volunteers, deadhead flowers before seeds mature.
- The plant’s hairy stems can be irritating to sensitive skin; wear gloves when handling.
- Excellent pollinator plant – bees adore borage flowers, making it a valuable addition to any garden aiming to boost pollination.
- Because it accumulates potassium and calcium, spent borage plants can be composted or used as a nutrient‑rich mulch.
