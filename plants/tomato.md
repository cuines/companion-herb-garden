# Tomato (*Solanum lycopersicum*)

## History & Cultural Significance

Tomatoes originated in western South America, where wild forms were small and likely yellow. They were domesticated by the Aztecs and other Mesoamerican peoples, who called them *tomatl*. Spanish conquistadors brought tomatoes to Europe in the 16th century, where they were initially regarded with suspicion (members of the nightshade family were thought to be poisonous). By the 18th century, tomatoes had become a staple of Mediterranean cuisine, especially in Italy, where they transformed into sauces, pastes, and the iconic pizza topping. Today, the tomato is one of the world’s most widely grown and consumed vegetables (though botanically a fruit).

## Growing Requirements

- **Sun**: Full sun (8+ hours daily) for optimal fruit production.
- **Soil**: Rich, well‑drained loam with plenty of organic matter; pH 6.2–6.8.
- **Water**: Consistent moisture, about 1–2 inches per week. Water at the base to avoid fungal diseases.
- **Temperature**: Warm‑season crop; requires daytime temps of 70–85°F (21–29°C). Frost‑sensitive.
- **Support**: Most varieties need staking, caging, or trellising to keep fruit off the ground.

## Companion Planting Guide

### Beneficial Companions

Tomatoes benefit from neighbors that repel pests, attract pollinators, or improve soil health.

- **Basil** – Repels tomato hornworms, whiteflies, and aphids; believed to enhance tomato flavor.
- **Marigolds** – French marigolds (*Tagetes*) release substances that suppress root‑knot nematodes.
- **Borage** – Attracts pollinators, deters tomato hornworms, and may improve tomato growth.
- **Carrots** – Tomatoes can provide light shade for carrots; carrots may help break up soil.
- **Onions & Garlic** – Repel spider mites and other pests.
- **Nasturtiums** – Trap crop for aphids, keeping them away from tomatoes.
- **Parsley** – Attracts hoverflies that prey on aphids.

### Antagonistic Plants

- **Brassicas** (cabbage, broccoli, cauliflower) – Tomatoes can inhibit the growth of these plants.
- **Corn** – Both are heavy feeders and can compete for nutrients; corn earworm also attacks tomatoes.
- **Fennel** – Secretes compounds that inhibit tomato growth.
- **Potatoes** – Share the same family (Solanaceae) and are susceptible to the same diseases (blight); planting together increases risk.
- **Walnut trees** – Juglone (a toxin released by walnuts) stunts tomato growth.

## Culinary & Medicinal Uses

### Culinary
- **Fresh salads** – Sliced, cherry, or heirloom varieties.
- **Sauces & pastes** – Cooked down for pasta, pizza, and stews.
- **Soups** – Tomato soup, gazpacho.
- **Canned, dried, or fermented** – Preserved as sun‑dried tomatoes, ketchup, or salsa.
- **Juices and beverages** – Tomato juice, Bloody Mary mix.

### Medicinal
- Rich in **lycopene**, an antioxidant linked to reduced risk of certain cancers and heart disease.
- High in vitamins C, K, potassium, and folate.
- Traditional uses for skin health and digestion.

## Quick Tips

- Rotate tomato planting locations each year to prevent soil‑borne diseases.
- Mulch around plants to retain moisture and reduce soil‑splash (which can spread blight).
- Remove lower leaves to improve air circulation and reduce fungal issues.
- For container growing, choose determinate (bush) varieties or large pots (5+ gallons).
