# Rosemary (*Salvia rosmarinus*)

## History & Cultural Significance

Rosemary is a woody, perennial herb native to the Mediterranean region. Its name derives from the Latin *ros marinus*, meaning “dew of the sea,” reflecting its coastal origins. In ancient Greece and Rome, rosemary was associated with memory and remembrance; students wore rosemary wreaths to improve recall. It was also used in wedding ceremonies as a symbol of fidelity and in funerals to signify remembrance. Medieval Europeans believed rosemary could ward off evil spirits and plague.

## Growing Requirements

- **Sun**: Full sun (6–8 hours daily); tolerates intense heat.
- **Soil**: Well‑drained, sandy or loamy soil; thrives in slightly alkaline pH (6.0–7.5). Excellent for rocky, poor soils.
- **Water**: Drought‑tolerant once established; water deeply but infrequently. Avoid over‑watering (root rot).
- **Temperature**: Hardy in USDA zones 7–10; can survive light frosts. In colder climates, grow in containers and bring indoors.

## Companion Planting Guide

### Beneficial Companions

Rosemary’s strong aroma repels many insect pests, making it a valuable guardian in the garden.

- **Cabbage family** (broccoli, cauliflower, kale) – Repels cabbage moths, carrot flies, and bean beetles.
- **Beans** – Rosemary deters Mexican bean beetles.
- **Carrots** – Helps repel carrot flies.
- **Sage** – Both Mediterranean herbs enjoy similar dry conditions and together create a pest‑deterring hedge.
- **Lavender** – Shares similar growing needs and aesthetic; both attract pollinators.
- **Thyme** – Compatible in herb gardens and rockeries.

### Antagonistic Plants

- **Basil** – While not strictly harmful, basil prefers more moisture and may struggle if planted too close.
- **Cucumbers** – Rosemary’s dry soil preference conflicts with cucumber’s need for consistent moisture.
- **Potatoes** – Rosemary can inhibit potato growth; keep separate.

## Culinary & Medicinal Uses

### Culinary
- **Roasted meats** – Classic seasoning for lamb, chicken, and pork.
- **Bread and focaccia** – Infused into olive oil or sprinkled on dough.
